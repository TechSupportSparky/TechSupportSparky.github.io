									<p>
										Hi there! My name is Ian and on the internet I go by Tech. I'm currently pursuing my BS degree in Computer Science 
										with a concentration in Game Systems as well as a minor in Game Design over at DePaul University. I'm a game programmer
										though I've dabbled in software design, game design, and system design and am interested in pursuing all these avenues!
									</p>
								</div>
								<h4>Where I'm from</h4>
								<p>
									I'm originally from a small town in Northern California where I grew up until heading to Chicago for college.  I can't
									say whether or not I prefer a big city to a town where everyone knows your name, but I've been content everywhere so
									far!
								</p>
								<h4>Interests / Hobbies</h4>
								<p>
									Outside of coding I enjoy creating music on my digital synthesizer (TE OP-1), creating "corruptions" a form of glitch art 
									similar to cartridge tilting on an old NES cartridge, and streaming said corruptions or other games on Twitch in my free time.
									<img src="images/BannerInterests.jpg" class="responsive">

								<h4>Favorite games</h4>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 0%;">A ton of these games I grew up playing for countless hours! Nearly every one of these titles I've also heavily enjoyed
									their subsequent sequels/prequels (with the only exception being Blinx and Runescape 3).

						<!-- Memory System -->
						<article id="memory-system" class="panel">
							<h4>Memory system</h4>
							<p>As C++ is written on top of C, we can utilize the facilities offered by C to improve the performance of our programs. One
								instance of where I took advantage of this relationship is with the creation of a custom memory system, which wraps the
								functions <i>malloc</i> and <i>free</i>.
								<img src="images/MemoryManager.jpg">
							</p>
							<p>We can create our own personal heap of memory to utilize as storage by allocating a block of memory using malloc.  From there
								we overload the <i>new</i> and <i>delete</i> operators in C++ with our own version of new and delete that the memory system
								provides. These new operations perform raw memory read/writes with bare minimum validation checking to improve performance
								without leaking memory. 
							</p>
							<h2>Unique improvements</h2>
							<p>One way I increased the performance of the overloaded new operator was to keep track of the last location that a block was freed
								via a delete call. In the best case scenario, this will avoid the need to traverse the entire heap to locate a contiguous block
								of memory given that the size of the free block is less than the requested size.

								A common problem that custom memory systems must face is fragmentation, which is the result of non-contigious blocks of memory
								allocated in the heap with variable gaps between each one.  To resolve this, we can perform coalescence upon deletion to merge
								non-contigious blocks into whole chunks once more.
							</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
							To test these results, I utilized a number of new/delete commands with a set dataset both on the built-in new/delete commands as well
							as the custom memory system's version. Overall, the custom memory system had similar performance runtimes for the delete operation,
							however for the new call I saw an improvement of around <b>5%</b>() in standard conditions and <b>15%</b> in the best case scenario.

							<h2>Particle System</h2>
							<p>Tools: <i class="devicon-cplusplus-plain colored">, </i><i class="devicon-visualstudio-plain colored"></i>, Perforce</p>
							<p>Towards the end of my Sophomore year I was given a particle system with some blatant performance issues.  Given three weeks,
							I was tasked with optimizing the system to the best of my ability to outperform my peers. To achieve this, I needed
							to utilize performance tricks and cleanup legacy code.  I employed the following strategies:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Rearranged the particle's data structure to make it cache friendly and allow for faster iteration by the engine.</li>
								<li>Utilized RVO (Return value optimization) on existing physics calculations to speed up their call time.</li>
								<li>Removed STL containers in favor of homemade data structures with less bloat.</li>
								<li>Changed function signatures to pass by reference rather than by copy/pointer when necessary to avoid large data transfers.</li>
								<li>Moved OpenGL calls out of update loop to only be called upon draw when needed.</li>
								<li>Initialized data prior to simulation to prevent initial jittering.</li>
								<li>Utilized SIMD to enhance vector and matrix operations.</li>
								<li>Swapping in my <a href="#memory-system">custom memory system</a></li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Results</h4>
							<p>The initial simulation prior to optimization ran in a total of <b>75.33 ms</b>.  After my optimization, I was able to bring this
							runtime down to a total <b>15.40 ms</b> or a performance ratio increase of <b>4.89</b>. </p>

							<h2>Developer Console</h2>
							<i>Tools: <i class="devicon-cplusplus-plain colored">, </i><i class="devicon-visualstudio-plain colored"></i>, Perforce</i>
							<p>While developing the <a href="assets/documentation/Documentation/html/index.html" target="_blank">Sly engine</a> I found an increasing desire
							to create visualization and debugging tools that would aid in development of my prototype game. I had created a handful of existing visualization
							tools that I could use as place markers and diagnostic statements, however I wanted something more robust than the ability to place a debugging 
							sphere in world space.</p>
							<div>
								<p style="float:left; margin-right:15px;"><img src="images/SrcConsole.gif"></p>
								<p>In my initial research I read up on history of command console usage from their birth in the early computing days to later runtime
									implementations.  My personal favorite and the console I took heavy inspiration from was the GoldSrc engine's console. Not only was the
									console capable of controlling gameplay related elements, it also allowed for engine level calls that could control higher level features
									while the game was in play.
								</p>
							</div>
							<p>The console system can be broken down into two major components which involve the <b>Keyboard to Screen</b> (including input, parsing, 
							rendering of text) and the<b>Command structure</b> (including a command broker, build-in commands, and a user command structure). For more
							information on this process, feel free to check out my initial <a href="assets/pdf/ConsoleResearch.pdf" target="_blank">research doc</a>.</p>
							<h4>Results</h4>
							<p>After completing the developer console (see console documentation <a href="/assets/documentation/Documentation/html/group___c_o_n_s_o_l_e___t_u_t_o_r_i_a_l.html" target="_blank">
							here</a>), I was quite satisfied with the results.  The console allowed me to quickly prototype features for my game prototype including positional data,
							engine queries, rapid level transitions, godcam toggle, etc. I had successfully achieved what I had sought out to do, create a console that would aid me while
							also creating a useful feature for any other developer that may choose to use my engine. </p>
							<p>I have create a developer console in my follow up "Pumpkin Engine" and plan to continue to include this useful tool!</p>

							<p>During my junior year at DePaul I created a clone of Centipede.  This served as a transition
								from basic programming to advanced system development. This project was the cornerstone of my
								later engine development and higher level classes.
							</p>
							<p>The game was created in a 10 week period with weekly sprints to plan and develop future content. While this was
								university led, the planning and implementation was entirely up me.  Creating Centipede allowed me to learn 
								and implement design patterns that may be useful within a game context.  A few of the design patterns I utilized
								include:
							</p>
							<ui>
								<li>Observer - Data collection</li>
								<li>Strategy - Blaster controls for AI and player</li>
								<li>Factory - Mushrooms, bullets, and sprites</li>
								<li>Singleton - Factories and managers</li>
								<li>Finite State Machine and State Pattern - Centipede movement</li>

							<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
							<p>This was not my first experience working in Unity as an engine, however our

								Unity 2D. Although, since Unity 2D is merely a flat scene with an orthographic camera
								facing the main plane, working in this variant is similar to the 3D experience.

								On occasion our team did face difficulty distinguishing 2D and 3D elements as objects
								are still textured and treated as 3D elements despite the 2D view, but overall once
								we were used to the workflow the production became much easier.
